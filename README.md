### Daggerfall Unity

The original code is not from me, I copied the 0.14.5 code from [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity).

You can be informed of the newest versions [here](https://www.dfworkshop.net/).

I hope making this project a mod for the original version, but for now this is a "Custom Build".

Here is a Tutorial to setup the thing to play online with steam [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEvdcE6smFQ).

# Get Daggerfall Unity

Daggerfall Unity requires a free copy of DOS Daggerfall to run. This provides all necessary game assets such as textures, 3D models, and sound effects.

You can get a free copy of DOS Daggerfall from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/) and a free copy of Daggerfall Unity from the [Releases](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/releases) page. Then simply unzip the latest version of Daggerfall Unity to its own folder and point it to the DOS version. Daggerfall Unity will take care of everything else.

Here are a couple of links with more detailed steps to help you get started using either Steam or a cross-platform process.

Enhance Daggerfall Unity gameplay by making language skills more viable and adding a new guild to the game, called "The Archaeologists Guild". Their mission is to delve into the history of Tamriel and they're interested in all creatures and races who have lived or still live there. Joining gives access to locator devices to aid in dungeon delving.

Finding My Religion is a multi-release visual and gameplay overhaul of Daggerfall's religions. The current release is "Detailed Temples", which decorates and redesigns the temples' according to the worshipped deity's sphere of influence. Julianos boasts a bigger library than others, Kynareth has an indoor garden, Mara has a birthing room and more. Each temple have been expanded downwards,  with priests' quarters and additional rooms for all service members. They also feature a crypt where people of importance have been buried.

Instead of increasing chance to avoid an attack completely, armor now reduces the damage you take, based on the material as well as the type of attack. Skills now determine most of your chance to avoid attacks, including many more features.
